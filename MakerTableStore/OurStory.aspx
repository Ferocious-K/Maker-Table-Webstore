Since the invention of the Bessemer process in 1850, metal shaping and fabrication have been limited to heavy industry and infrastructure projects. Leaving the cheaper materials like wood and plastic for domestic use. Steel was simply too difficult to work with and required huge, expensive equipment to process efficiently. Today, computer controlled torches and tool positioners make the process much more efficient. Our CNC plasma table uses no tooling or special dies, it relies on computer code instead of specially machined jigs. This allows us to modify our designs based on your needs not the other way around. We don't have to make 10,000 of the same thing, we can make 10,000 things differently. Metal fabrication is no longer measured by the ton, it's available for everyone.
